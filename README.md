# TucanTournament

Tucan Tournament is a tournament where several players compete in several sports. Right now, the sports
played are basketball and handball matches. They plan to add more sports in the future.
You have been contacted to create a software solution to calculate the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the
tournament.
You will receive a set of files, each one containing the stats of one match. Each file will start with a row
indicating the sport it refers to.
Each player is assigned a unique nickname.
Each file represents a single match.
The MVP is the player with the most rating points, adding the rating points in all matches.
A player would receive 10 additional rating points if their team won the match. Every match must have a
winner team. One player may play in different teams and positions in different matches, but not in the
same match.
The program responsible of generating the files has a bug, that can be reflected in wrong files format. If
one file is wrong, the whole set of files is considered to be wrong and the MVP won't be calculated.
